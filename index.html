<h2>Introduction, the farm.</h2>

<p class="test" id="introduction">

Ytre Eikjo is an idyllic roadless farm in a fjord in the western part of Norway.
That once belonged to my great-great-grandfather Mons Eikum.
And he was the last farmer of Ytre Eikjo before he started to split it up into smaller properties.
On one of those, I and my brother and my sister have today our family cabin.
It has become a special place for me, and perhaps it will be a place that arouses your curiosity.
I will at least try to gather here some of the historic pieces of this place.

<p class="test" id="eikjastrondi">

The farm is a farm under Eikjastrondi <span id="ref-1a" class="ref-mark"><a href="addenda/sources.html#source-1">¹</a></span> in the luster municipality together with three others.
The source says that Eikjastrondi is a grend, the closest denotation for this in English would be a hamlet.
I feel that the farms are too scattered for being called that.
But it is at least an area that extends from Notedalen (Notedal) in the north-east to Ytre Eikjo in the south-west.
With a road that goes to Vedviki (Vedvik) via Notedalen.
Then it is a little over a kilometer of rugged terrain to Ytre Eikjo, where all traffic has to go by boats.
In the other direction, there are about five kilometers to the nearest road in the village of Solvorn.
