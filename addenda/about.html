<h2>About</h2>

<p class="test" id="me">
My name is Terje Urnes, and are the author and editor of this site.  As I have said earlier, I am also a great-great-grandson to Mons Eikum. I made this site in April 2021. The goal s to try to stitch together some of the histories of Ytre Eikjo. As I have got older, I have become more interested in my family history, sadly, especially after my parents passed away.
